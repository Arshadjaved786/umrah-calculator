# Umrah Calculator (Ready React + Tailwind project)

## Quick start

1. Extract the ZIP and open the folder in VS Code.
2. In VS Code Terminal run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
3. App runs at http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is busy).

## Notes
- This project uses Create React App structure and Tailwind CSS (configured).
- If `npx tailwindcss init -p` was failing on your machine, this ZIP already includes the required config files.
- If you see warnings about deprecated packages, they are safe to ignore for this demo.
